     * The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
        We divide modifiers into two groups:

            * Access Modifiers - controls the access level
            * Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality
    
     * Access Modifiers
       * public - The code is accessible for all classes
       * private - The code is only accessible within the declared class
       * protected - The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.
