public class guessNumber {
    /**
     * We are going to make a GAME
     * The concept is: Generating a random number and ask the user to guess the number,
     * continue asking until you receive the correct number
     * after 5 times of guessing show a game over message
     * 
     * Here is how it works!!
     * Show a welcome message on the screen
     * Ask the user's name and say hello to the user
     * Ask if we should start the game
     * After receiving a positive answer generate a random number and ask for the user guess
     * If the user guess is correct show a congratulation message
     * If the number is not correct, ask again until you receive the correct answer
     * As a hint, beside the first time, every time that you are asking for a number, tell the user to guess higher or lower
     * If the user failed 5 times, show a game over message and quit the game
